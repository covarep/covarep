MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Runtime is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 9.0 (R2015b).   

. If the MATLAB Runtime is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MATLAB Runtime installer.

  (2) run the MATLAB Runtime installer.

Or download the Windows 32-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2015b 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see
