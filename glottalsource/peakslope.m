% A parameter which is essentially a correlate of spectral tilt, derived
% following wavelet analysis. This parameter is effective at discriminating
% lax-tense phonation types.
%
% Octave compatible
%
% Description
%  The peakslope parameter is derived by using wavelet analysis to decompose
%  the speech signal (or glottal source signal) into octave bands. A sliding
%  window is then used for measuring time-domain maxima in the different
%  frequency bands. A regression line is fit to log10 of these peaks, and
%  the slope coefficient is used as the peakSlope parameter. For the wavelet
%  analysis, different scaled versions of a cosine modulated gaussian pulse
%  are convolved with the input signal (as is done in d'Alessandro 2011 and
%  Tuan & d'Alessandro 1999).
%
% Inputs
%  s               : [samples] [Nx1] input signal
%                    (speech signal or glottal source)
%  fs              : [Hz]      [1x1] sampling frequency
%
% Outputs
%  PS              : [time,slope] [Mx2] outputted peakSlope parameter,
%                    and time instance [s]
%
% Example
%  Please see the HOWTO_glottalsource.m example file.
